                The Brotherhood of Nod
                (often shortened to Nod or the Brotherhood)
                is a worldwide, quasi-religious and political movement
                devoted to the charismatic figure of Kane, and the
                harnessing of the extraterrestrial Tiberium substance by
                Earth's downtrodden peoples. Although the Brotherhood
                first emerged in 1995, the year of Tiberium's arrival,
                Nod had existed as an ancient and secret society long before
                this, and claims to have originally been founded around 1800
                BC. During the course of the 21st century,
                the Brotherhood began to exhibit the combined
                characteristics of a world religion, a massive decentralized
                nation-state, a high-tech multinational corporation, and an
                unorthodox superpower.
                Core Nod beliefs include that Kane is an eternal
                prophet figure, whose guidance to humanity allegedly
                dates back through millennia of secrecy, and that
                Tiberium represents the catalyst for the next stage of
                human evolution.
                At the end of the 20th century, the
                Brotherhood was officially designated a worldwide
                terrorist organization by the United Nations-sanctioned
                Global Defense Initiative; for dangerous misuses of the
                Tiberium substance, the founding of a rogue military-industrial
                complex throughout disenfranchised countries,
                instigating social and political upheaval across first
                world nations, and for pursuing a total domination over the
                world's peoples and resources.The Brotherhood would
                consequently face off against the UN's GDI in four
                successive world wars, restoring itself after two
                military defeats, and finally achieving Kane's vision
                during the later two conflicts, bringing Nod's prophecy to
                its fulfillment
