        <p>The Global Defense Initiative (GDI) was a 
            global peacekeeping force. It was founded in 
            accordance with the United Nations Global Defense Act 
            (UNGDA), on October 12, 1995. The GDI's initial goal was to 
            preserve world order by combating global terrorism, epitomized 
            by the Brotherhood of Nod.
            During the First Tiberium War, a global conflict between GDI 
            and Nod over the alien substance Tiberium, GDI discovered that
            Tiberium was highly toxic to terrestrial life, but not before it had spread to 
            the entire world due to its economic benefits. GDI eventually defeated Nod, destroying its 
            headquarters in Sarajevo and apparently killing its leader, Kane. It then began the long 
            process of evacuating civilians 
            from the growing Tiberium contamination.
            In the decades that followed, GDI played a key role in 
            combatting Nod, containing Tiberium, and evacuating civilians 
            from Tiberium-contaminated areas. Over time, member
            nations gradually ceded power and sovereignty to GDI. 
            By 2047, GDI had become a de facto political and military 
            superstate.
