                The Scrin, or Visitors, are a powerful and technologically
                advanced alien race, suspected to be related to the origins
                of the Tacitus. Calling Tiberium "Ichor", the Scrin have a
                dependence on the substance and will die if they do not receive
                Tiberium infusion or radiation from a Relay Node.
                The Scrin are suspected to have been the ones who originally
                seeded Earth with Tiberium using a meteor, intending to
                harvest the mineral after it had reached a sufficient
                concentration by extracting it with Threshold Towers. However,
                Kane tricked GDI into causing a premature liquid Tiberium
                explosion, luring the Scrin mining force to Earth. Commanded
                by Foreman 371 and its AI assistant, they were unprepared
                for the military resistance of the native humans, expecting a
                dying populace in disarray. Eventually, GDI pushed them back
                and destroyed the Relay Node, killing all their forces,
                while the Foreman retreated through the last remaining
                Threshold.
